# Python Pandas Study Notes

These are the notes I took when learning pandas from Corey Schafer's youtube series. 

***All the notes are in the markdown file [notes.md](https://github.com/mezanur/pandas_notes/blob/master/notes.md)***

Additionally added the jupyter notebooks that I made when practicing along the video series.
